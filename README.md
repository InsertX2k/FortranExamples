# FortranExamples
A Simple **GitHub Repository** containing the source codes I wrote during my journey to learn **Fortran 90**. <br>

## If you want to compile : <br>
If you have **GNU GCC Compiler** installed : 

```sh
gfortran <file-name>.f90 -o <file-name>
```

## If you want to run the compiled file : <br>

```sh
./<file-name>
```

<br>

#### I used repl.it's IDLE to work on fortran, because I don't know how to install Fortran and GNU GCC Compiler for Windows.
